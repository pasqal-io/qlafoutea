# Qlafoutea

Qlafoutea \kla.fu.ti\ 
- (clafoutis) a crustless pie prepared from pourable batter and black cherries
- (Quantum Language of Formulas, User-facing Translation and Extension Architecture)
  a highly-experimental language designed to let developers and scientists write
  quantum algorithms and test them on existing and future quantum hardware without
  first having to study for a PhD in quantum mechanics.

Qlafoutea was born from the observation that most (if not all) of the tools currently
available to develop quantum algorithms assume:

1. That the user of these tools has achieved PhD-level in quantum mechanics (in addition
    to their own field).
2. That the user of these tools can easily navigate (and generally, cares about) the
    distinction hardware currently available for usage, hardware still in development,
    hardware that only exists on paper, the various kinds of emulators, and general
    quantum hype.
3. That the user of these tools is interested in building algorithms from scratch
    rather than interested in the result or the performance.
